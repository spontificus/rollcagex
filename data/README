Unless the structure in this directory is obvious, here's a simple explanation:

* cars				- directory containing different themes
 \
  * <theme>			- themes - it's just as the original games
   \
    * <car>			- cars owned by that team (again, just like the original games)
    |\
    | * settings		- vehicle characteristics
    |\
    | * 3d			- vehicle 3d file (containing coordinates for triangles making up the car) - not implemented in this version
     \
      * texture<value>		- texture files(s) for decoration of the car

* tracks
 \
  * <location>			- environments (different places like: other planets, in tunnels, cities, sea close)
   \
    * <track>			- tracks in the environment
